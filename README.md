# BOP-ATM
## Overview
BOP-ATM is a simulation program for basic functions of an automated teller machine (ATM), written in the C language. The user can use their account or create a new one to carry out financial transactions (deposits, withdrawals, and transfers). Additionally, the user has the ability to check their account balance, account details, and transaction history. The user inputs the required data and makes selections by typing characters, while the corresponding data output is printed in a console window. Each accountâ€™s details, as well as all transactions that have taken place, are stored in relevant files.
